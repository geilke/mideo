# mideo
MiDEO is a framework to perform data mining on probabilistic condensed representations. It builds on online density estimates that estimate the joint density of data streams.

In the next couple of weeks, we will provide some infrastructure for future data mining algorithms and implement the algorithms proposed in

Michael Geilke, Andreas Karwath, Eibe Frank, and Stefan Kramer. *Online Estimation of Discrete Densities*. In: Proceedings of the 13th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM 2013), pp. 191-200, IEEE 2013. [doi:10.1109/ICDM.2013.91](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICDM.2013.91).
